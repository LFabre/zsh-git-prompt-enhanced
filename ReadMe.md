# Enhanced Git Prompt for ZSH

A __Zsh__ plugin which provides a more granular information about a git repository.

The Enhanced Git Prompt can show information about the current branch/hash name, it can tell if there is an upstream branch being tracked and the difference in commits between the upstream. When there is any stash entries a flag will be shown.

The prompt also provides information about the changes on the repository. It will show the amount of files modified, deleted, conflicted, staged and untracked.

This plugin is entirely written in bash and uses a few functions from the `/lib/git.zsh` provided by the `Oh-my-zsh`
